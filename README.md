# ireadlogs
This is a small python module that parses logs such as [this](ftp://ita.ee.lbl.gov/traces/NASA_access_log_Aug95.gz) 
available at [NASA-FTP](ftp://ita.ee.lbl.gov/traces/), 
and produces a JSON report with next information:
1. Top requested pages and the number of requests made for each
2. Percentage of successful requests (anything in the 200s and 300s range)
3. Percentage of unsuccessful requests (anything that is not in the 200s or 300s range)
4. Top 10 unsuccessful page requests
5. The top 10 hosts making the most requests, displaying the IP address and number of
requests made.
6. For each of the top hosts, show the top 5 pages requested and the number of
requests for each page
7. The log file contains malformed entries; for each malformed line, display an error
message and the line number.

Command line options may alter the produced results with regards to the number of top hosts and pages, 
the top hosts - pages breakdown and the reporting of errors.
